# Java Programming 1 MOOC University of Helsinki
 
This is the first part of the [University of Helsinkiâ€™s free massive open online course (MOOC) on Object-Oriented Programming with Java](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/).
The course is split up into two individual courses: *Java Programming I* and *Java Programming II*. Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set.

Those present in the repo are my solutions to the exercises I held **from 01/05/2020 to 26/05/2020** of the **Java Programming 1**, Part 1 to 7.

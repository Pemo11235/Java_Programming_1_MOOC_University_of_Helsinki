# Java Programming 1 MOOC University of Helsinki
 
This is the first part of the (University of Helsinkiâ€™s free massive open online course (MOOC) on Object-Oriented Programming with Java)[https://java-programming.mooc.fi/].
The course is split up into two individual courses: Java Programming I and Java Programming II. Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set.

Those present in the repo are my solutions to the exercises I held from 01/05/2020 to 26/05/2020 of the Java Programming 1, Part 1 to 7.
